To add all the changes you've made:

git add .

To commit them:

git commit -m "MY MESSAGE HERE" #-m is the message flag

You can put those steps together like this:

git commit -a -m "MY MESSAGE HERE"

To push your committed changes from your local repository to your remote repository:

git push origin master

You might have to type in your username/password for github after this. Here's a good primer on using git. A bit old, but it covers what's going on really well.


-- 

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/ProdiagnosticoDev/Epsilon2.git
git push -u origin master  |  -u  para crearla si no existe


-- cambiar a branch 

git checkout master
